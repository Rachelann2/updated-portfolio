            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
            making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
            at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
            obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
            going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
            discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
            (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
            This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
            the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
            sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                                <h3> PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY</h3>
                                <p> I am a driven UC Davis college graduate, with a degree in Biological Sciences and
                                    the
                                    human body. I worked all throughout college determined to work hard to support
                                    myself
                                    while getting a degree. I am energetic, articulate, positive, upbeat and creative.
                                    From
                                    High School I have always been involved, working as a team with many adults and
                                    fellow
                                    classmates. My first job was a YMCA Camp Counselor over the summer, working with
                                    kids
                                    from 5-12 years old. The following year I worked at a San Diego Florist shop
                                    arranging
                                    flowers and coordinating bouquets. Throughout my four years of studying at UC Davis
                                    I
                                    have worked at a local gym called TEAMride as a Studio Crew Member in Sacramento,
                                    CA. My
                                    position consisted of setting up new members on their bikes, helping costumers with
                                    memberships and creating an atmosphere for a challenging and enjoyable workout.
                                    Finding
                                    a passion in the fitness community I took courses through “Spinning” to become a
                                    certified spin instructor and have taught rhythm-based spin classes at Fithouse in
                                    Davis, CA and was a seasonal hire Educator at Lululemon at Arden Fair mall. At
                                    Lululemon
                                    I learned about the importance of connection with people and hustle behind hard
                                    work. I
                                    now currently work at Bueno Sport and Swim as their sales manager as well as
                                    teaching
